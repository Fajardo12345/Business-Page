	<p>While the Chicago 1 originally retailed for $64.99 in 1985, and has hit the sale rack in decades past, it is valued at much more in todayâ€™s market given its level of rarity. Now, at an average price of $18,000, you can own the same Chicago 1s that Michael Jordan wore in his rookie season.</p>
