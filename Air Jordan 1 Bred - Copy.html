	<p>In 2017, Jordan Brand gifted the Parisian concept store colette with its own Air Jordan 1 in honor of their 20th Anniversary and store closing. The Air Jordan 1 colette took the colette’s signature blue and white color scheme and decorated the design with insignias symbolizing the store’s incredible 20 year run. Pairs were exclusively distributed to friends and family of the store, but a few pairs made their way to StockX where they have averaged a price above $13,000, becoming one of the most expensive Jordans on the market.</p>
