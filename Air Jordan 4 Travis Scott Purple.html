	<p>Upon the release of the Jordan 4 Retro Travis Scott Cactus Jack, a limited number of Jordan 4 Retro Travis Scott Purple F&F were gifted to La Flame’s friends and family. For a while, many fans believed that this new colorway would eventually release to the public. It was later confirmed by Travis’ DJ, Chase B, that these shoes would never see mass production. This confirmation of exclusivity has made the Purple Travis Jordan one of the rarest shoes in Travis’ journey with Jordan Brand and the most expensive Air Jordan in StockX history. It costs $25,000</p>
