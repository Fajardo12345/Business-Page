	<p>Continuing this tradition in 2014, the Oregon men’s basketball team was given the Air Jordan 5 Oregon Ducks Duckman, a special iteration of the design that featured the Oregon Duck mascot striking Michael Jordan’s renowned Jumpman pose. This pair has skyrocketed in value over time and now resells at an average price of $13,000, cracking the top 10 most expensive Jordans on StockX..</p>
